# Contributing to The Last Light: An Open Intellectual Project

Welcome. This book is structured as an open intellectual project, and we welcome contributions from colleagues, peers, and intellectually curious readers. The goal is not to solicit code contributions, but to foster a rigorous and collaborative dialogue around the book's central thesis and arguments. We encourage you to engage with the ideas presented here using the established conventions of open-source development.

This document outlines how you can participate in this ongoing conversation.

## How to Engage

We have adapted the standard GitHub workflow to suit a process of intellectual inquiry. There are two primary ways to contribute:

1.  **Open an Issue: Propose a Counterargument, Question a Premise, or Suggest New Evidence**

    If you wish to challenge a claim, question a line of reasoning, or suggest a new piece of evidence (such as a recent study, article, or event) that is relevant to a specific chapter, the best way to do so is by "Opening an Issue."

    *   **How:** Navigate to the "Issues" tab of this repository.
    *   **Title:** Create a clear and concise title, e.g., "Counterargument to the 'Oppenheimer Fallacy' in Part-00" or "New Data on Cognitive Offloading for Part-01."
    *   **Body:** In the body of the issue, please articulate your point as clearly as possible. If you are proposing a counterargument, please structure it logically. If you are suggesting new evidence, please provide a link to the source and a brief explanation of its relevance.
    *   **Labels:** Use labels to categorize your issue (e.g., `counterargument`, `new-evidence`, `question`).

2.  **Submit a Thematic Pull Request: Incorporate a New Perspective or Data Point**

    For those who wish to more directly contribute to the text, we welcome "Thematic Pull Requests." This is the equivalent of proposing a specific edit to a chapter to integrate a new perspective, add a clarifying paragraph, or incorporate a new data point.

    *   **How:**
        1.  **Fork the repository** to your own GitHub account.
        2.  **Create a new branch** off of the `discussion` branch. Please do not target the `main` branch directly. The `main` branch is reserved for the stable, canonical version of the manuscript.
        3.  **Make your changes:** Edit the relevant chapter file(s) to incorporate your proposed changes.
        4.  **Submit a Pull Request:** Open a pull request from your branch to the `discussion` branch of this repository.
    *   **Justification:** In the description of your pull request, you must provide a detailed justification for the change. Explain what your change accomplishes and why it strengthens the book's argument or addresses a weakness.

## The `/discussion` Branch

To maintain the integrity of the main manuscript, all pull requests should be directed to the `/discussion` branch. This branch serves as a staging area for proposed changes and ongoing debates. It allows for a more fluid and collaborative process of revision without destabilizing the primary text. Periodically, well-vetted and integrated changes from the `discussion` branch will be merged into the `main` branch.

## A Living Document

By framing intellectual engagement in this way, we hope to transform this repository from a static monologue into a dynamic dialogue. Reading becomes an active, collaborative process. We believe this approach is uniquely suited to the subject matterâ€”a topic that is evolving as rapidly as the technology it seeks to understand. We look forward to your contributions.
