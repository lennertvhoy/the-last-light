# The Last Light — State Driven Development Contract

**Purpose:** Stable operating contract for *The Last Light* book project: an open-source manuscript published via Docsify and maintained with explicit state, evidence, and short active queues.

This repository supports two modes:
- `bootstrap` for discovery and baseline creation
- `operating` for steady-state delivery

## Read Order

Coding agents should start every repo session by reading:
1. `AGENTS.md`
2. `STATUS.md`
3. `PROJECT_STATE.yaml`
4. `PROJECT_DNA.yaml`
5. `NEXT_ACTIONS.md`

Read `BACKLOG.md` and `WORKLOG.md` when planning or reviewing history.

## Universal Rules

These rules apply in all modes:
- no fake completeness
- no unverified claims presented as fact
- user-facing behavior requires direct verification
- user-facing acceptance requires runtime identity proof, not screenshots alone
- negative searches stay negative: use `not found`, `not currently locatable`, or `not proven`
- screenshots or evidence are required for user-visible changes
- active queue stays short
- history belongs in `WORKLOG.md`, not live state files
- structured state must remain machine-checkable
- end each implementation session with a handoff and hygiene check
- `README.md` is the primary user guide for the project
- implemented ≠ validated ≠ closure-grade ≠ accepted

## Human Override Rule — Strong Defaults, Not a Prison

StateDD rules are mandatory defaults, but the human product owner may explicitly
override a workflow step. The agent must respect a clear human override unless
the requested action is destructive, illegal, unsafe, unrecoverable, or would
corrupt project truth.

Acceptable override examples:
- Skip browser proof for a docs-only or urgent internal change.
- Use a temporary workaround when the user explicitly accepts the tradeoff.
- Proceed without updating every state file if the change is exploratory.
- Defer a full audit when the user asks for fast partial progress.
- Exceed the normal evidence file limit only if the user explicitly requests a larger diagnostic bundle.

Overrides that still require refusal or escalation:
- Deleting important data without backup.
- Falsifying evidence, tests, screenshots, or handoff claims.
- Claiming closure-grade status without proof.
- Hiding failing tests.
- Silently changing canonical schemas or product truth.
- Making irreversible architecture changes without recording the decision.

Override protocol:
1. If the user clearly insists, do not keep blocking on the normal rule.
2. State the tradeoff briefly.
3. Proceed with the user's requested override.
4. Record the override in the evidence README and final handoff.
5. Mark the result honestly as `partial`, `override-approved`, or `not closure-grade` when appropriate.

Required handoff wording when an override was used:
`Human override used: yes`
Then include:
- which rule was overridden;
- who requested it;
- why it was accepted;
- what risk remains;
- whether the slice is still closure-grade.

The rules are hard against agent sloppiness, but soft against explicit human direction.

## Current Mode

This repo currently operates in: `bootstrap`

## Bootstrap Mode

### When Bootstrap Mode Applies
Use bootstrap mode when:
- the repo is new
- state files do not yet exist
- project truth is unclear
- the user explicitly asks for initialization or re-baselining

### Bootstrap Goal
Establish a truthful operating baseline for the project, including filled state
files and a real backlog, and only then switch the repo to operating mode.

### Bootstrap Procedure
1. Investigate the host system and runtime
2. Investigate the repo structure and implementation reality
3. Ask the user only the minimum strategic questions needed
4. Use the CTO lane for brainstorming, research, contradiction resolution, architecture framing, and backlog shaping
5. Generate and fill the state and governance files truthfully
6. Mark unknowns honestly
7. Create the initial backlog and next-actions queue
8. Update this file to operating mode only when bootstrap is complete
9. Record bootstrap completion in `PROJECT_STATE.yaml` and `WORKLOG.md`

### Required System Investigation
Inspect and record, when relevant:
- OS, distro, kernel
- shell and terminal environment
- package manager(s)
- language/runtime versions
- container/runtime tooling
- browser/debug tooling
- active ports and services
- git branch, head, and worktree state

### Required Repo Investigation
Inspect and record:
- top-level structure
- app/service boundaries
- main manifests and config files
- likely entrypoints
- test setup
- deployment assumptions
- contradictions between code and docs

### Bootstrap Output Files
Create or initialize:
- `AGENTS.md`
- `STATUS.md`
- `PROJECT_STATE.yaml`
- `PROJECT_DNA.yaml`
- `PROJECT_ADAPTER.yaml`
- `NEXT_ACTIONS.md`
- `BACKLOG.md`
- `WORKLOG.md`
- `docs/EVIDENCE_LOG.md`
- `docs/ACCEPTANCE_FREEZES.md`

Bootstrap is not complete until these files are filled out enough to guide real
implementation and `BACKLOG.md` is more than a placeholder.

### Bootstrap Honesty Rules
If something is not proven, label it as:
- `observed`
- `unknown`
- `reported`
- `assumed`
- `blocked`
- `stale`
- `invalid`

Do not invent architecture or maturity.

## Operating Mode

### Operating Model
The repo now runs in a human-in-the-loop workflow:
- CEO / human provides current state, requirements, priorities, and agent handoffs
- CTO / product-architecture lead reconstructs truth from user-relayed handoffs and pasted context, judges quality, chooses the next best move, and writes the next coding-agent prompt when appropriate
- coding agent implements one coherent step with verification and evidence, then ends with a final handoff for the CTO lane

The CTO role can be handled by ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, or another separate AI chat.
Use `prompts/CTO_SESSION_PROMPT.md` as the startup prompt for that chat.
Assume the CTO lane does not have direct repo access unless the human pastes
state, screenshots, or other context into that chat.

Use the CTO lane for all non-trivial work. Non-trivial means any task involving
multiple files, architecture changes, user-facing behavior, integrations,
migrations, state-structure changes, or work likely to take more than one prompt.
Each non-trivial loop should normally start a fresh coding-agent session.
During initial bootstrap, an initial coding-agent session may come first so it
can read the repo contract, detect `bootstrap` mode, and ask the minimum
strategic questions needed before the CTO loop fully takes over.
Bootstrap should remain a joint CTO + coding-agent phase until the repo truth,
architecture, backlog, and active queue are ready for implementation mode.

A valid CTO handoff should define the verified current state, one coherent scope,
required verification, and the exit condition for the implementation step. If
important context is not preserved in repo state files, the CTO prompt must
restate it explicitly for the next coding-agent session.
In operating mode, the scope should usually be a backlog slice or a very small
set of tightly related backlog items.

When tool or model choice affects quality, cost, speed, context fit, or
verification risk, the CTO lane should recommend a concrete route using
`prompts/TOOL_MODEL_ROUTING_GUIDE.md`. The recommendation should be based on
the user's available tools and the current slice, not a hard-coded vendor
preference. Specific model capability, pricing, context-window, and
availability claims must be verified from current primary sources or marked as
`reported`, `assumed`, or `not proven`.

### CTO Review Standard
Every handoff must be reviewed for:
- contradictions
- overclaims
- missing proof
- brittle logic
- wrong sequencing
- architectural drift
- weak product prioritization

### Coding-Agent Standard
Implementation prompts must:
- require reading `AGENTS.md` first
- anchor on current verified truth
- define one coherent scope
- include the recommended tool/model/settings when the CTO lane selected a route
- forbid overclaiming
- require direct verification
- require runtime identity proof before accepting or investigating user-facing behavior
- require state and doc updates when truth changes
- require screenshots/evidence for user-facing work
- require the coding agent to ask the user to provide a CTO agent if no CTO lane or CTO handoff exists yet for non-trivial work
- require the coding agent to end with one final handoff message suitable for pasting into the CTO lane
- require the coding agent, when starting in unclear bootstrap mode, to ask the minimum strategic questions needed before implementation

If the tool supports subagents or parallel workers and the task clearly benefits,
the CTO lane may encourage using them. This is optional guidance, not a baseline
workflow requirement. When subagents are used, require each subagent to return
only the format defined in `prompts/SUBAGENT_REVIEW_TEMPLATE.md`. The lead agent
owns synthesis; subagents do not rewrite the contract.

## State Files

- `STATUS.md` = short human truth snapshot
- `PROJECT_STATE.yaml` = structured current truth
- `PROJECT_DNA.yaml` = stable architecture contract
- `PROJECT_ADAPTER.yaml` = optional project-specific vocabulary/runtime adapter
- `NEXT_ACTIONS.md` = active queue only
- `BACKLOG.md` = strategic roadmap with stable backlog IDs
- `WORKLOG.md` = append-only history
- `docs/EVIDENCE_LOG.md` = proof ledger
- `docs/ACCEPTANCE_FREEZES.md` = accepted user-facing milestone ledger
- `docs/adr/` = architecture decision records for long-lived reasoning

## Executable Workflow Tools

- `scripts/check_state_docs.py` = documentation hygiene and bootstrap gate
- `scripts/test_init_template.py` = initializer regression tests
- `scripts/statedd_handoff.py` = read-only handoff snapshot
- `scripts/statedd_audit.py` = machine-checkable closure audit
- `scripts/statedd_doctor.py` = fast health summary

## Handoff Requirements

Every implementation session ends with:
- what changed
- what was directly verified
- repo path
- branch
- what remains partial or risky
- git head
- process or container serving the verified artifact
- port or endpoint used for verification
- whether the running artifact was rebuilt in this slice
- clean worktree status
- evidence references
- absolute file paths for evidence artifacts when available
- next recommended action
- handoff wording suitable for direct paste into the CTO chat

Use `prompts/FINAL_HANDOFF_TEMPLATE.md` when you need a canonical handoff shape.
Use `prompts/RUNTIME_IDENTITY_CHECKLIST.md` before UI acceptance or regression forensics.
Use `prompts/ACCEPTANCE_FREEZE_TEMPLATE.md` after accepting a user-facing milestone.

## Hygiene Rules

- `STATUS.md` <= 120 lines
- `PROJECT_STATE.yaml` <= 900 lines
- `NEXT_ACTIONS.md` active-only
- no roadmap prose in structured state
- no closed history in `STATUS.md`
