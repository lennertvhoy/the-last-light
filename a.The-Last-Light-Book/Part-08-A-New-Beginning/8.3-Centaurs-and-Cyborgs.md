# Chapter 8.3: Models of Collaboration: Centaurs, Cyborgs, and Curators

The "Jagged Technological Frontier," the metaphor introduced by the HBS/BCG study, describes the uneven capabilities of AI, where it excels at some tasks but fails at others that seem deceptively similar. As the frontier shifts, so too must our understanding of how humans collaborate with AI. The HBS/BCG study identified two primary models:

**The Centaur:** Named after the mythical half-human, half-horse, this model represents a clear division of labor. The human provides strategic direction, creative vision, and ethical judgment, while the AI "horse" provides the raw processing power and rapid execution. This is the expert augmentation model. More advanced conceptions of this model describe a "symbiotic learning" process, where the human and AI are not just partners but are in a continuous feedback loop, creating a merged intelligence that outperforms either entity alone.

**The Cyborg:** This model represents a deeper, more seamless integration where the AI becomes an extension of the user's mind. The human outsources a significant portion of their cognitive load to the machine, which is common among novices who rely on the AI for every step of a process. While this can lead to impressive short-term gains, it carries the long-term risk of over-reliance and what researchers call "falling asleep at the wheel"â€”a state of automation complacency where the user loses the ability to critically supervise the AI's output.

However, this binary framework has been criticized as overly simplistic. An alternative model, the **Curator**, has been proposed to describe a more cautious and discerning mode of interaction. The Curator is an AI-literate professional who understands the technology's limitations. They do not fully delegate like a Centaur or fully integrate like a Cyborg. Instead, they carefully evaluate and select AI tools for specific tasks, incorporating them only when they enhance work without compromising human expertise and judgment. This model is crucial for roles in fields like medicine, law, and journalism, where ethical oversight, quality control, and accountability are paramount.

The truly "extraordinary" person in the age of AI is a meta-expert who knows when to be a Centaur, when to be a Cyborg, and when to be a Curator. An expert navigates this spectrum of interaction modes depending on the task. A lawyer might act as a "Cyborg" for a routine task like drafting a standard email (outsourcing cognition for speed). They might then switch to a "Centaur" for complex legal research, providing strategic queries to an AI that sifts through millions of documents (delegating execution). Finally, when reviewing the AI's proposed legal argument for a high-stakes brief, they must become a "Curator," critically evaluating the output for nuance, ethical implications, and strategic soundness (exercising judgment). The key future skill is not just using AI, but possessing the metacognitive awareness of how to use AI in different contexts.
