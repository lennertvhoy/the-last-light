# The Last Light: A Field Guide to Our Digital Crossroads

**The Last Light** is an open-source book exploring the collision between human consciousness and artificial intelligence. Drawing on neuroscience, philosophy, cyberpunk literature, and economics, it maps the terrain of our species' most consequential crossroads — the moment when our tools become our successors.
