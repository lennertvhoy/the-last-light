# An Expanded Scholarly Review of Appendix EE: Kierkegaardian Philosophy in the Digital Age

Introduction: The Enduring Relevance of the Particular

Søren Aabye Kierkegaard (1813–1855), a Danish philosopher of astonishing prolificacy and intellectual depth, developed a body of work that stands as a trenchant critique of the rationalist, system-building philosophies of his time.1 His primary philosophical target was the abstract, totalizing system of G.W.F. Hegel, a conceptual edifice Kierkegaard believed subsumed the concrete, existing individual into the universal, impersonal march of Spirit, thereby rendering personal existence an accidental footnote in a grand, logical narrative.3 In opposition, Kierkegaard championed the cause of the subjective, focusing on the question of what it means to be an existing, finite human being—a concern he termed "inwardness".6 He argued that his age had forgotten this fundamental truth, a profound failure manifested in both its philosophy and its theology.6
The insights forged in this 19th-century intellectual crucible have proven to be of remarkable and enduring relevance for understanding the existential quandaries of the 21st-century digital age. The contemporary landscape, characterized by what has been termed "digital overwhelm," "identity confusion," and a technologically-driven "erosion of freedom and responsibility," presents a new and formidable battleground for the Kierkegaardian project of achieving authentic selfhood.7 The core conflict this analysis will explore is that between the subjective, irreducible, and passionately chosen existence of what Kierkegaard called
den Enkelte ("the single one") and the objective, universalizing, and optimizing logic of algorithmic systems and technological determinism.8
Kierkegaard's pertinence today extends beyond mere prescience. A deeper analysis reveals a structural analogy: the abstract "System" he critiqued in Hegelian philosophy has found its concrete, global implementation in the technological infrastructure of the digital age. The philosophical struggle of the 19th century has become the lived, socio-technical reality of the 21st. Contemporary technological systems, particularly those driven by artificial intelligence and big data, operate on a logic strikingly similar to the one Kierkegaard opposed. They abstract individual users into quantifiable data points, subsume them into demographic and behavioral categories analogous to "the crowd," and optimize for universal principles such as efficiency, engagement, or profit maximization.8 Consequently, Kierkegaard's critique of Hegel's
System functions not merely as a historical parallel but as a direct structural critique of the operational logic of the modern technological apparatus. In a sense, the digital world has constructed the abstract "palace" of totalizing knowledge that Hegel only designed, leaving individuals to the Kierkegaardian task of discovering how to live authentically in the "shack nearby".11
This appendix provides the scholarly foundation for Chapter 8.2's exploration of Kierkegaardian responses to digital obsolescence. It undertakes a rigorous examination of his core concepts—the spheres of existence, anxiety, the single one, and faith—and demonstrates their profound applicability to the challenges posed by artificial intelligence, algorithmic governance, and the pervasive mediation of human experience by digital technologies. By placing Kierkegaard's thought in dialogue with contemporary philosophy and empirical research in psychology, neuroscience, and anthropology, this review will establish a robust framework for preserving human agency and meaning in an increasingly automated world.

Part I: The Kierkegaardian Framework for Authentic Existence

The Dialectic of Selfhood: The Three Spheres of Existence

Kierkegaard's analysis of human existence is famously structured around three fundamental modes of being, often referred to as "stages" or, more accurately, "spheres of existence": the aesthetic, the ethical, and the religious.12 These are not to be understood as a rigid, linear progression that every individual must follow in sequence. Rather, they represent dynamic, overlapping, and often competing life-views, each defined by a different relationship to choice, meaning, and authenticity.12 The transition from one sphere to another is not a natural development but a qualitative "leap" precipitated by existential crises such as despair, guilt, or doubt, and requiring a profound act of individual will.12 The relationship between the spheres can be understood through a concept borrowed from his philosophical adversary, Hegel:
Aufhebung, wherein a lower stage is simultaneously canceled, preserved, and elevated into a higher one.16 The ethical, for instance, does not destroy the aesthetic but "transfigures" it, recontextualizing its passions within a framework of commitment.16

The Aesthetic Sphere: The Life of Immediacy and Distraction

The aesthetic sphere is the default mode of human existence, characterized by the pursuit of immediate pleasure, novelty, and sensory experience.13 The aesthete lives for the moment, seeking constant stimulation to avoid the ultimate terror: boredom. Choice in this sphere is not a matter of deep commitment but of momentary preference, a continuous sampling from the buffet of experience without ever choosing a single dish for a lifetime.12 Kierkegaard explores this life-view through archetypes like Don Juan, the sensualist who seeks infinite pleasure through a finite series of conquests, and Faust, the intellectual aesthete who seeks infinite knowledge.16 In both cases, the self remains fragmented, defined by external stimuli rather than an internal, unifying principle. This life, lacking any integrating narrative or ultimate meaning, inevitably leads to despair—the recognition that a life built on fleeting moments is ultimately empty.13
This 19th-century diagnosis maps with startling accuracy onto the architecture of the 21st-century digital environment. The modern parallel to the aesthetic life is the dopamine-driven engagement with social media, the endless scroll through personalized content feeds, and the superficial consumption of information as a form of fleeting stimulation.7 The business model of the attention economy is predicated on capturing and retaining users within this very sphere. Mechanisms such as gamified notifications, ephemeral "stories," and algorithmically curated novelty are technologically engineered to provide an unending stream of immediate gratification, thus preventing the reflective pause or the onset of boredom that might catalyze a transition to a more committed form of existence.8 This technological implementation of the aesthetic sphere's core drives means that the transition to a more authentic mode of being is no longer merely a psychological challenge; it requires a conscious act of resistance against a powerful and pervasive technological infrastructure designed to keep the user in a state of perpetual, uncommitted consumption.

The Ethical Sphere: The Life of Universal Duty and Rational Choice

The transition out of the aesthetic sphere's despair is made through a decisive choice: the choice of oneself. This act marks the entry into the ethical sphere, a mode of existence governed by universal moral principles, social duty, and rational self-discipline.12 The ethical individual, exemplified by Judge Vilhelm in
Either/Or, moves from self-centered pleasure-seeking to a life of responsibility and commitment.12 Choices are no longer based on whim but are guided by a coherent and consistent moral framework, often derived from social institutions like marriage, vocation, and the state.16 Here, the self achieves a form of unity and authenticity by aligning its actions with higher ethical ideals and taking responsibility for its past and future.12
This mode of existence finds its modern parallel in the logic of algorithmic decision-making systems. These systems are designed to operate according to universal, rational principles, optimizing for predefined ethical goals such as efficiency, utility maximization, fairness, or harm reduction. Whether in credit scoring, automated hiring, or content moderation, these technologies embody the ethical sphere's commitment to consistent, universal rules, applying them impartially to all individuals (O'Neil, 2016; Noble, 2018). However, just as Kierkegaard identified the limits of the ethical sphere, this algorithmic parallel reveals its own deficiencies. The ethical life ultimately founders on the rock of its own limitations; it cannot account for sin, guilt, or the particularity of the individual's relationship with the absolute.12 When faced with a situation where the universal ethical demand conflicts with a higher, divine command—as in the case of Abraham—the ethical framework collapses, revealing its insufficiency for achieving the highest form of existence.18

The Religious Sphere: The Life of Faith and Passionate Subjectivity

The breakdown of the ethical sphere, often experienced through profound guilt and the recognition that "in relation to God we are always in the wrong," necessitates another leap into the religious sphere.15 This sphere transcends both aesthetic preference and ethical universality. It is characterized by an absolute, passionate, and subjective commitment of the individual to the absolute (God).16 This is the realm of faith, which Kierkegaard defines not as a set of beliefs but as a deeply personal relationship that can require a "teleological suspension of the ethical"—setting aside universal moral law for the sake of a higher purpose known only to the individual in their relationship with God.18
Kierkegaard distinguishes between two forms of this sphere: Religiousness A and Religiousness B.13 Religiousness A is a religion of immanence, characterized by "infinite resignation." The individual recognizes the limits of the temporal world and resigns their earthly desires to relate to an eternal ideal, often leading to a form of suffering and withdrawal from the world.19 Religiousness B, which for Kierkegaard is synonymous with paradoxical Christianity, goes a step further. It is the religion of the absurd. After making the movement of infinite resignation, the "knight of faith" makes a second movement, believing that by virtue of the absurd, they will receive back what they have resigned—that the impossible is possible for God.20 This is the faith of Abraham, who resigns Isaac completely yet believes he will receive him back.
In the digital age, the religious sphere finds its parallel not necessarily in conventional piety, but in the conscious, willed choice to uphold distinctly human values and pursue an authentic existence, even when such choices appear irrational or inefficient from the perspective of technological systems. It is the decision to prioritize compassion over algorithmic efficiency, to offer forgiveness where data suggests risk, or to engage in creative, "unproductive" acts in a world obsessed with optimization. This represents a "teleological suspension of the technological"—a deliberate choice to act according to a higher, subjective value system that cannot be justified by the universal, rational "ethics" of the algorithm. It is the ultimate assertion of human authenticity in the face of a system that recognizes only calculable utility.

The Vertigo of Possibility: Anxiety (Angst) and Freedom

Central to Kierkegaard's psychological and philosophical project is his analysis of anxiety, or Angst. In his seminal 1844 work, The Concept of Anxiety, he distinguishes this state sharply from fear.21 Fear has a specific object—one is afraid
of something. Anxiety, in contrast, has no object; its object is nothingness itself. For Kierkegaard, anxiety is the existential condition that arises from the confrontation with one's own freedom. It is "freedom's actuality as the possibility of possibility"—the dizzying, vertiginous feeling that emerges when an individual recognizes their radical freedom and the infinite potentiality of their existence.21 He famously illustrates this with the image of a man standing on the edge of a cliff: he fears falling, but he feels anxiety at the possibility that he could
choose to throw himself off. This is the "dizziness of freedom".21
This anxiety is profoundly ambivalent. It is the precondition for the Fall, as it is the state of innocence confronting possibility that precedes the "qualitative leap" into sin.21 Kierkegaard argues that "anxiety about sin produces sin".21 Yet, it is also the necessary catalyst for salvation and authentic selfhood. Anxiety is what educates the individual, stripping away finite concerns and revealing the gravity of existence. By confronting the groundlessness of one's being, the individual is moved from a state of "un-self-conscious immediacy to self-conscious reflection," making authentic choice possible.21 The complexity and paradoxical nature of the concept led one scholar to suggest that the book's maddening difficulty is a deliberate stylistic choice, meant to evoke in the reader the very dizziness it describes.23
In the digital age, this concept of anxiety finds a powerful new resonance, but with a paradoxical twist. On one hand, the digital environment amplifies traditional Kierkegaardian Angst to an unprecedented degree. The internet presents a near-infinite field of possibilities for identity construction, social connection, and information consumption, leading to what has been termed "post-digital Angst".8 This constant confrontation with boundless choice can be paralyzing. Contemporary psychological research on "choice overload" provides empirical validation for this Kierkegaardian insight. Studies by researchers such as Barry Schwartz and Sheena Iyengar have demonstrated that an excess of options, far from being liberating, often leads to increased anxiety, decision paralysis, and decreased satisfaction with the choices that are made.25 This is the felt, psychological experience of the "dizziness of freedom" in a consumerist and digital context.
On the other hand, the digital age introduces a novel and uniquely modern form of anxiety. If traditional Angst arises from the vertigo of radical, unconstrained freedom, a new "predictive anxiety" emerges from the confrontation with technological systems that seem to eliminate that freedom. Algorithmic systems, from recommendation engines to predictive analytics, function by modeling and forecasting human behavior with ever-increasing accuracy, creating a world that feels increasingly determined.8 The individual is thus caught in a paradoxical double bind: they experience the classic anxiety of being overwhelmed by infinite choices, while simultaneously experiencing a new, second-order anxiety that their choice is already known, predicted, and instrumentalized by an opaque system. The vertigo is no longer simply about the abyss of what
I can do, but about the abyss of what is already known that I will do. This creates an existential crisis where the feeling of freedom seems both overwhelming and illusory, hollowing out the very meaning of human agency from within.

The Irreducible Subject: The Category of 'the Single One' (den Enkelte)

The cornerstone of Kierkegaard's entire philosophical project, and the category he claimed as his own to the point of wishing it for his epitaph, is that of "the single one"—den Enkelte.28 This concept functions as his primary polemical weapon against all forms of abstraction and depersonalization, whether it be Hegel's philosophical "System," the anonymous and irresponsible "crowd," or the leveling influence of "the public".5 For Kierkegaard, authentic existence can only be lived by a concrete, particular individual; no universal system, collective entity, or abstract concept of "humanity" can substitute for the subjective reality and absolute responsibility of the single existing person.31
Den Enkelte is not simply a synonym for "the individual." It is a qualitative, normative, and fundamentally religious category.30 It is an existential reality that cannot be fully expressed through rational concepts but must be lived and experienced.31 Its nature is theocentric, as the single one is defined by their unique, personal relationship with God, standing alone before the absolute.30 This category represents, for Kierkegaard, the "Pass of Thermopylae" for the spirit: a narrow passage through which each person must go alone to achieve true, eternal significance. It is a path that cannot be "negotiated en masse".29 While this emphasis on the singular might appear to be a retreat from social life, scholars argue that it is, in fact, the very foundation for true human equality and authentic community, which stands in stark contrast to the false unity and moral abdication of the crowd.33
This central Kierkegaardian category stands in direct and irreconcilable opposition to the logic of the digital age. The modern phenomenon of the "quantified self"—the practice of translating personal experience into data points for tracking, analysis, and self-optimization—represents the ultimate inversion and negation of den Enkelte. Where den Enkelte insists on a qualitative, ineffable, and subjective reality that resists conceptual capture, the quantified self operates on the premise that the self can be fully captured, understood, and improved by being rendered as a series of divisible, measurable, and objective metrics: steps taken, hours slept, calories consumed, moods logged.
This process of quantification transforms the individual from a subject of existence into an object of analysis. It shifts the locus of self-understanding from the domain of "inwardness" to an external dashboard, replacing subjective reflection with objective data. The logic of the quantified self is thus the logic of abstraction and leveling applied directly to the individual's own being. It encourages a form of self-objectification that is the antithesis of the Kierkegaardian task of becoming a subject. The fundamental struggle for authenticity in the digital age is therefore between the imperative to become "that single one" and the pervasive pressure to become a legible and optimizable collection of one's own data.

The Passionate Commitment: Subjective Truth and the Leap of Faith

Kierkegaard's conception of faith is one of his most radical and widely misunderstood contributions. It is a direct challenge to both religious dogmatism and rationalist philosophy. For Kierkegaard, particularly as articulated by his pseudonym Johannes Climacus, faith is not primarily about the content of belief (the "what") but about the mode of believing (the "how").34 He famously defines truth as subjectivity: "An objective uncertainty, held fast through appropriation with the most passionate inwardness, is the truth, the highest truth there is for an existing individual".34 Faith, therefore, is not belief in the absence of evidence, but a passionate commitment made in the full recognition of objective uncertainty. It is "the contradiction between the infinite passion of inwardness and the objective uncertainty".34
This commitment inherently involves risk, paradox, and the potential for what appears, from a rational standpoint, to be absurdity.11 The archetypal figure of faith is Abraham, as analyzed in
Fear and Trembling by the pseudonym Johannes de Silentio.18 Abraham's willingness to sacrifice his son Isaac at God's command represents the "teleological suspension of the ethical." He is called to suspend a universal ethical duty (thou shalt not kill) for the sake of his particular, absolute duty to God.18 This act cannot be explained or justified in the universal language of ethics; it is intelligible only within the private, paradoxical relationship between the single one and God. This is the "leap of faith"—an action that cannot be mediated by reason but is undertaken with total personal responsibility.35 It is this leap that allows the individual to organize their desires and take ultimate responsibility for their own existence, orienting themselves toward a higher good that transcends rational proof.36
In the context of the digital age, which is governed by a pervasive logic of optimization and data-driven rationalism, the Kierkegaardian leap of faith takes on a new, secular meaning as a principle of anti-optimization. The dominant ethos of our technological systems is the elimination of uncertainty and the calculation of the most efficient, profitable, or effective path based on utilitarian metrics. This is the technological equivalent of the universal "ethical" sphere that Abraham was asked to suspend.
A contemporary leap of faith, therefore, can be understood as the radical act of choosing a value or a course of action that is demonstrably suboptimal according to this computational logic. It is the assertion of a different, subjective system of value that prioritizes the human over the machine. Examples of such a leap might include: a manager choosing to hire a candidate with a non-traditional background based on an intuitive assessment of their character, defying the optimized output of an HR algorithm; an artist choosing to devote years to a project with no clear market value or return on investment; or an individual choosing to forgive a transgression when a cost-benefit analysis of the relationship would advise termination. From the perspective of the technological system, such an act is "absurd." It is a willed suspension of the data-driven imperative. It posits that there is a higher telos—authentic human relationship, creativity, mercy, love—that justifies suspending the "ethical" rules of the algorithm. This act represents the ultimate assertion of passionate, subjective human agency against the encroaching determinism of the optimized world.

Part II: Kierkegaard in Dialogue with Philosophical Modernity

Contrasting Paths to Selfhood: Kierkegaard and Nietzsche

Placing Søren Kierkegaard in dialogue with Friedrich Nietzsche (1844-1900) illuminates two of the most powerful and divergent responses to the crisis of modernity. Though Nietzsche likely never read Kierkegaard's work, their philosophies exhibit profound structural similarities in their diagnoses of the age, even as they propose diametrically opposed remedies.37 Both were "problem thinkers" who rejected the systematic, rationalist traditions of their predecessors, particularly Hegel.3 Both emphasized the subjective nature of truth and morality, critiqued the spiritual vacuity of their contemporaries, and railed against the leveling influence of "the crowd" or "the herd".39 Both saw that the traditional foundations of Western civilization were crumbling.
The crucial point of divergence lies in their response to this collapse. Both thinkers diagnose the same fundamental problem of their era: the decline of a shared, objective moral and metaphysical framework, a condition Nietzsche would famously term the "death of God".38 They saw 19th-century European society as failing to grasp the terrifying implications of this event, living in a state of superficial conformity. From this shared diagnosis, however, they chart two archetypal and mutually exclusive paths forward.
Nietzsche's response is to stare into the abyss and command humanity to become its own god. With the transcendent anchor for values gone, meaning must be created, not discovered. This is the project of the Übermensch (Overman), the individual who can overcome nihilism by asserting their "Will to Power" and forging new values from the crucible of their own strength.38 For Nietzsche, any submission to an external principle, especially the Christian God, is the ultimate life-denying act, a "slave morality" that stunts personal growth and inhibits the individual's potential.38 Truth, for Nietzsche, must be made to submit to the will of greatness.3 This is a project of human self-deification.
Kierkegaard's response is precisely the opposite. For him, the crisis is not the absence of God but the loss of a genuine, passionate, and individual relationship with God. The modern malady is that Christianity has become a comfortable social convention, a set of doctrines to be rationally assented to rather than a life to be existentially lived.38 The solution, therefore, is not to replace God but to rediscover the arduous, inward path to him through the stages of existence, culminating in the paradoxical leap of faith. The highest state for the Kierkegaardian individual is not the assertion of their own will, but the submission of that will to God.3 This is a project of self-realization before God.
The rise of artificial intelligence and the prospect of algorithmic governance introduce a third possibility: a new, external, non-human system of order and meaning. This technological "god" of optimization forces a choice between the Nietzschean and Kierkegaardian paths. The Nietzschean response might be to embrace this new power, to merge with or master technology in an effort to become a "technological Overman," transcending the limitations of biological humanity. The Kierkegaardian response, by contrast, would be to reject this new system as another form of idolatry, just as he rejected the idolatry of the Hegelian System and of institutional "Christendom." It would be to insist, with ever greater passion, on the preservation of the unique, subjective, non-optimizable human self in the face of a new, all-encompassing universal.

The Existentialist Legacy: Freedom, Absurdity, and Authenticity

Kierkegaard is widely, if sometimes problematically, regarded as the "father of existentialism".2 His profound influence shaped the core themes of the major figures of 20th-century existentialism, who adopted and adapted his analyses of anxiety, freedom, despair, and the individual's struggle against the anonymous crowd.42 However, in transmitting these concepts, the later existentialists largely secularized them, a transformation that fundamentally altered their meaning and implications.
Jean-Paul Sartre (1905-1980): Sartre's famous dictum, "existence precedes essence," is a direct philosophical descendant of Kierkegaard's emphasis on radical freedom and self-creation.4 For both thinkers, the human being is not a fixed entity but a project, defined by the choices they make. However, their foundations are starkly different. Sartre's philosophy is explicitly atheistic; freedom is a terrifying "condemnation" because there is no God to provide a pre-ordained human nature or objective values.41 Kierkegaard's freedom, conversely, is only intelligible and meaningful in relation to God; it is the capacity to enter into or fail to enter into a right relationship with the power that constitutes the self.4 As some scholars note, Kierkegaard would have fundamentally rejected Sartre's premise that existence precedes essence, arguing instead that the self's essence is its God-relationship, which it is the task of existence to actualize.42
Martin Heidegger (1889-1976): The influence of Kierkegaard on Heidegger's early masterpiece, Being and Time, is undeniable and pervasive. There is a clear lineage from Kierkegaard's critique of "the crowd" and "the public" to Heidegger's analysis of inauthentic existence as absorption in das Man ("the They" or "the one").5 Heidegger's seminal analysis of anxiety (
Angst) as the fundamental mood that discloses the individual's Being-towards-death and calls them back to their authentic potential is a direct ontological development of Kierkegaard's psychological and theological treatment of the same concept.44 Despite this deep debt, Heidegger himself was often dismissive of Kierkegaard, classifying him as a "religious writer" who explored existentiell (personal, experiential) questions but failed to pose the properly existential (ontological, structural) question of the meaning of Being itself.46
Albert Camus (1913-1960): Camus's concept of the absurd—the irresolvable conflict between humanity's innate desire for meaning and reason, and the "unreasonable silence of the world"—echoes Kierkegaard's description of faith as a confrontation with paradox.48 However, Camus famously critiques Kierkegaard for committing "philosophical suicide".50 He argues that Kierkegaard correctly identifies the absurd but then, unable to bear it, leaps into the irrational embrace of God, thereby negating the very tension he had discovered.51 For Camus, the only authentic response to the absurd is not faith but revolt: to live in full, lucid awareness of the conflict without hope or resignation.48 This critique, however, is based on a significant misreading. As contemporary scholarship argues, the Kierkegaardian leap of faith is not an escape from the absurd but a way of
living within it. Faith does not eliminate the paradox; it presupposes and even enhances it, allowing the individual to endure the absurd without succumbing to nihilistic despair.50
In inheriting Kierkegaard's powerful diagnosis of the human condition—anxiety, despair, alienation—the 20th-century existentialists largely jettisoned his theological framework. This secularization left them with a profound analysis of the problem but without his proposed solution. Kierkegaard's concept of despair, as detailed in The Sickness Unto Death, is a spiritual malady, a fundamental misalignment of the self that can only be cured by "resting transparently in the power that established it"—that is, God.34 The secular concepts of Sartre's "nausea," Heidegger's "inauthenticity," and Camus's "absurd" are all descendants of this Kierkegaardian diagnosis. Yet their proposed remedies—radical freedom, authentic resoluteness, perpetual revolt—are all immanent solutions. From a Kierkegaardian perspective, these are noble but ultimately insufficient responses located within the ethical sphere. They lack the transcendent dimension of the religious sphere, which for Kierkegaard is the only true antidote to the deepest forms of despair. Consequently, while these secular existentialisms offer powerful tools for critiquing the inauthenticities of the digital age, they risk leading back to the very nihilism they seek to overcome. Kierkegaard's framework, by contrast, offers a positive, albeit paradoxical, foundation for meaning.

Part III: Empirical Resonances in 21st-Century Science

The Psychology of Algorithmic Mediation

While Kierkegaard's analyses were rooted in philosophical introspection and theological reflection, a remarkable body of contemporary psychological research provides strong empirical support for the negative existential consequences he anticipated from the erosion of authentic, individual choice. Modern studies on choice, agency, and motivation serve as an empirical echo of his 19th-century insights.
Choice Overload and the Anxiety of Freedom: Kierkegaard's description of anxiety as the "dizziness of freedom" finds a direct corollary in the modern psychological phenomenon of "choice overload".25 Pioneering research by Barry Schwartz (2004) and Sheena Iyengar & Mark Lepper (2000) demonstrated that when presented with an excessive number of options, individuals often experience not liberation, but paralysis, anxiety, and diminished satisfaction with their eventual choice.27 This counterintuitive finding—that more choice can lead to less well-being—empirically validates the Kierkegaardian claim that confronting infinite possibility without a committed framework is an anxiety-provoking state. While recent research has added nuance, suggesting that the choice overload effect is context-dependent and that "choice deprivation" can be an even greater source of dissatisfaction, the core insight remains: the structure of choice profoundly impacts our sense of agency and well-being.53 The endless options presented by streaming services, e-commerce platforms, and social media feeds create a digital environment ripe for this form of existential vertigo.
Locus of Control and Algorithmic Determinism: The psychological concept of Locus of Control (LoC), developed by Julian B. Rotter (1966), distinguishes between individuals who believe they have control over the outcomes of their lives (internal LoC) and those who believe outcomes are determined by external forces like fate, luck, or powerful others (external LoC). A vast body of research has correlated an internal LoC with greater psychological well-being, resilience, and life satisfaction.55 The pervasive influence of algorithmic systems poses a significant threat to the cultivation of an internal LoC. Recommendation engines that shape our cultural tastes, predictive policing algorithms that assess our risk, and social media feeds that curate our reality can foster a sense of powerlessness, shifting our perceived LoC from internal to external.58 This creates a technologically-induced fatalism. Interestingly, recent research has shown that in contexts of extreme structural constraint, such as severe poverty, an external LoC can be an adaptive psychological response, as it more accurately reflects the reality of one's limited agency.58 This provides a powerful, if unsettling, analogy for how individuals might psychologically adapt to the perceived "structural violence" of an inescapable and deterministic digital environment.
Self-Determination Theory and the Thwarting of Autonomy: According to Self-Determination Theory (SDT), developed by Edward Deci and Richard Ryan (2000), human well-being is contingent on the satisfaction of three innate and universal psychological needs: autonomy (the need to feel volitional and self-directed), competence (the need to feel effective and masterful), and relatedness (the need to feel socially connected).59 When these needs are met, individuals flourish; when they are thwarted, well-being suffers.59 Many digital architectures, particularly those designed around the attention economy, systematically undermine these needs. By prioritizing passive consumption, endless scrolling, and the pursuit of superficial external validation (likes, shares), they thwart the need for genuine autonomy and competence.61 The user is encouraged to be a reactor to stimuli rather than a self-directed agent.
These psychological frameworks do not merely exist in parallel; they interact in a reinforcing causal loop. Digital technologies are often designed to exploit pre-existing psychological tendencies (e.g., the aesthetic desire for novelty). This engagement, in turn, can erode the very psychological capacities (e.g., an internal LoC, the exercise of autonomy) required to resist the technology's pull. For instance, algorithmic curation presents itself as a solution to choice overload, but by consistently making choices for the user, it reduces opportunities to develop autonomous decision-making skills. This fosters a dependency where the erosion of agency makes the user more reliant on the system, which further erodes their agency. The system creates the problem (overwhelming choice) and then sells a "solution" (curation) that ultimately deepens the underlying existential issue: the atrophy of the authentic, self-determining self.

The Neuroscience of Volition: Preserving a Space for Agency

The most direct scientific challenge to the concept of human agency, and thus to the entire Kierkegaardian project, has come from the field of neuroscience. The famous experiments conducted by Benjamin Libet in the 1980s seemed to provide startling evidence that free will is an illusion.63 Using EEG to monitor brain activity, Libet found that a specific neural signal, the "readiness potential" (RP), consistently began to build in a subject's brain approximately half a second
before the subject reported a conscious awareness of the intention to act.65 The common interpretation was devastating: our brains unconsciously "decide" to act, and our conscious experience of willing that action is merely an afterthought, a story we tell ourselves after the fact. This neuro-determinist view would render Kierkegaard's passionate emphasis on choice and responsibility moot.
However, in recent years, this interpretation of the Libet findings has faced a profound and compelling challenge from a new wave of neuroscientific research, fundamentally reopening the space for meaningful agency.64 A pivotal reinterpretation, advanced by researchers such as Aaron Schurger and Jacobo D. Sitt, proposes that the readiness potential is not the signature of an unconscious "decision" at all.63 Instead, using stochastic accumulator models, they argue that the RP reflects the "ebb and flow of background neuronal noise".63 In this model, the brain of a subject waiting to make a spontaneous movement is in a state of constant, random neural fluctuation. The decision to act corresponds to the moment when these random fluctuations cross a certain threshold, triggering the movement. The slow build-up of the RP is simply an artifact of averaging these processes backward in time from the action; it looks like a build-up, but it is actually the signature of a random process reaching a tipping point.63
This reinterpretation has crucial philosophical implications. It dissolves the problem of a mysterious unconscious agent making decisions without our awareness. The "decision" is the threshold-crossing event itself, which is much closer in time to our conscious awareness. This model provides a physical basis for the state of "possibility" that Kierkegaard described as preceding a choice.
This neuroscientific debate ultimately liberates Kierkegaardian philosophy from the need to solve the metaphysical problem of uncaused causation. A sophisticated understanding of agency, compatible with both Kierkegaard and modern neuroscience, is not about a conscious mind initiating an action from a metaphysical void. Rather, agency can be located in the conscious, passionate endorsement and assumption of responsibility for an action that may be initiated by complex, non-conscious neural processes. The meaning of an act, in Kierkegaardian terms, resides not in the mechanics of its causal origin but in the "how" of the subjective commitment to it. Even if the initial impulse to act emerges from the stochastic noise of the brain, the crucial human moment is the act of consciously affirming that impulse, of owning it, of taking responsibility for it with "passionate inwardness." Neuroscience may describe the physical mechanism of volition, but Kierkegaard's philosophy describes the existential meaning of engaging with that mechanism as a free and responsible self.

The Anthropology of the Individual: Beyond Western Individualism

A common critique leveled against applying Kierkegaard's thought universally is that his intense focus on den Enkelte, the single one, is a culturally specific artifact of Western individualism, and thus has limited relevance in more collectivist societies. This argument often relies on frameworks like Geert Hofstede's influential dimensions of national culture, which places societies on a spectrum from individualism (prioritizing the "I") to collectivism (prioritizing the "we").67 From this perspective, Kierkegaard's impassioned plea for the individual against the crowd could be dismissed as a product of his particular European, Protestant context.
This critique, however, suffers from two major flaws. First, it relies on an overly simplistic and increasingly contested model of culture. Scholarly critiques of Hofstede's framework are numerous and significant, pointing to its oversimplification of complex cultural realities, its reliance on outdated data from a single multinational corporation, its inherent Western bias, and its failure to account for cultural dynamism and change.69 Culture is not a static, monolithic variable that can be reduced to a few dimensions.
Second, and more fundamentally, the critique misreads the nature of Kierkegaard's category by conflating the concept of the individual as the locus of identity with the individual as the locus of responsibility. While cross-cultural research demonstrates vast differences in how the self is construed—with many non-Western cultures emphasizing a relational or interdependent self-concept 71—this does not eliminate the role of individual moral agency. Recent anthropological and psychological studies show that even within strongly collectivist cultures, notions of personal choice, moral accountability, and individual conscience remain crucial.73 Collectivism may prioritize group harmony and goals, but it does not dissolve the individual into an undifferentiated mass.
Kierkegaard's concept of den Enkelte is not primarily a statement about social identity. It is a theological and ethical claim about the ultimate locus of accountability. His central argument is that each person must stand alone before God, must make their own leap of faith, and must bear absolute responsibility for their own existence.29 No group, no family, no state, no "crowd" can perform this existential task for the individual. This is a claim that transcends the individualism-collectivism dichotomy. An individual from a highly collectivist culture, who derives their primary sense of self from their social roles and relationships, still faces, in the Kierkegaardian view, the singular task of confronting their own freedom, their own mortality, and their own relationship with the eternal. Therefore, the category of
den Enkelte is not a rejection of communal identity; it is the assertion that, regardless of one's social embedding, the ultimate questions of existence must be faced by "that single one."

Part IV: Applications and Prescriptions for an Authentic Digital Future

Designing for Authenticity: A Kierkegaardian Critique of Digital Architecture

Applying the Kierkegaardian framework as a critical lens reveals that many dominant paradigms of contemporary digital design systematically promote inauthentic modes of existence. The architecture of the digital public square is not a neutral container for human interaction; it is an environment with a built-in telos, one that often runs counter to the development of an authentic self. By prioritizing engagement, seamlessness, and data collection, these systems create what can be termed an "aesthetic trap," locking users into a cycle of distraction and superficiality that inhibits the reflection necessary for ethical and religious development.10 The systematic aggregation and organization of all information, exemplified by platforms like Google, can be seen as the new Hegelian "System" that Kierkegaard critiqued—an edifice that promises total objective knowledge at the expense of subjective, contemplative truth, or what Kierkegaard called
Betragtning (contemplation).76
A Kierkegaardian approach, however, can do more than just critique; it can inspire a set of alternative design principles aimed at fostering authenticity rather than merely capturing attention. Such principles would include:
Preserving Meaningful Choice Architecture: Instead of designing systems that converge on a single, algorithmically optimized path, technology could be designed to present users with genuinely distinct and meaningful choices. This would require a shift from predicting and satisfying user preferences to challenging and developing them, forcing conscious engagement over passive acceptance.
Introducing "Positive Friction": The dominant design ethos of "frictionless" experience, which aims to make user journeys as seamless and thoughtless as possible, is a direct enabler of the aesthetic mode. A Kierkegaardian alternative would be to introduce moments of "positive friction"—deliberate pauses, reflective prompts, or "speed bumps" that disrupt the flow of passive consumption and encourage a moment of conscious thought before proceeding.
Designing for Contemplation (Betragtning): In an attention economy, time is money, and any moment not spent actively engaging is a loss. A human-centered alternative would be to create digital spaces that are intentionally "inefficient." This could mean designing interfaces that prioritize depth over speed, that encourage long-form reading and single-tasking, and that measure success not by engagement metrics but by the quality of reflection they enable. Such spaces would function as digital hermitages, providing refuge from the "noise of the world" that Kierkegaard lamented.76
The following table synthesizes the core concepts of Kierkegaard's philosophy and maps them onto their contemporary digital manifestations, clarifying the specific threats each poses to the project of authentic existence.
Kierkegaardian Concept
Core Definition
Primary Digital Manifestation
Threat to Authentic Existence
Aesthetic Sphere
Pursuit of immediate pleasure, novelty; avoidance of commitment.
Infinite scroll, personalized feeds, gamified notifications, ephemeral content (Stories).
Perpetual distraction; prevention of boredom/reflection needed for deeper commitment.
Ethical Sphere
Commitment to universal, rational principles and duties.
Algorithmic moderation, "fairness" in AI, utility maximization in logistics/ad-tech.
Reduction of complex human morality to simplistic, optimizable rules; abdication of personal moral judgment.
Anxiety (Angst)
The "dizziness of freedom" from confronting infinite possibility.
Choice overload (e.g., streaming libraries); Predictive analytics that render choice seemingly meaningless.
Paralysis in the face of too many options; existential dread that one's freedom is an illusion.
The Crowd/Leveling
The anonymous public that absolves individuals of responsibility.
Anonymous online mobs, virality-driven discourse, filter bubbles that create a false consensus.
Erosion of individual accountability; homogenization of thought and opinion.
den Enkelte
The irreducible, responsible individual subject.
The "quantified self" and the data-double/user profile.
Reduction of the ineffable subject to a legible, optimizable object; self-alienation.
Leap of Faith
A passionate commitment beyond rational justification.
Data-driven decision-making; A/B testing culture that demands empirical justification for all choices.
Elimination of space for intuitive, value-based, or "irrational" human choices that defy optimization.

The Right to be 'That Single One': Policy, Ethics, and Digital Rights

The existential challenges posed by technology are not merely personal; they are increasingly becoming matters of public policy and legal debate. Emerging regulatory frameworks, such as the European Union's landmark Artificial Intelligence Act, can be interpreted as societal attempts to legislate a protected space for human agency against the totalizing logic of technological optimization.78 When viewed through a Kierkegaardian lens, these legal texts are not just about safety and risk management; they are about preserving the very possibility of authentic human existence.
A key provision in the EU AI Act is the requirement for "human oversight" in high-risk AI systems.80 Article 14 of the Act mandates that such systems must be designed so they can be "effectively overseen by natural persons".80 The stated goal is to "prevent or minimise the risks to health, safety or fundamental rights".81 Crucially, this oversight must enable the human user to "decide, in any particular situation, not to use the high-risk AI system or to otherwise disregard, override or reverse the output of the high-risk AI system".80 While some critics have noted the potential vagueness of these provisions and the risk that they could become a form of "rubber stamping," the principle itself is profound.82
This legal mandate for a human "override" capability is a legislative echo of Kierkegaard's "teleological suspension of the ethical." The AI system, by its nature, operates entirely within the ethical sphere: it applies universal, pre-programmed rules to data in a consistent and rational manner. Its output represents the "correct" decision according to its universal logic. The demand for "meaningful human control" is a demand for a human agent to be able to intervene and make a decision that may directly contradict the AI's "ethical" recommendation. This act of overriding the algorithm is a suspension of its universal rule. The human overseer performs this suspension based on factors that are inherently unquantifiable and particular to the situation: intuition, mercy, a holistic understanding of context, or a value judgment that the system cannot compute.
In this sense, policies demanding a "right to human decision-making" are attempts to legally protect what Kierkegaard would recognize as the space of the religious sphere of existence. They are an effort to build a legal firewall to prevent the ethical sphere (in its new, algorithmic form) from completely colonizing all aspects of human life. By doing so, they preserve the possibility of the "exception"—the unquantifiable, non-optimized, passionately chosen, and authentically human act. They are, in effect, a legal defense of the human capacity for the leap of faith against the tyranny of the algorithm.

Conclusion: The Leap of Faith in an Age of Algorithmic Certainty

Søren Kierkegaard's philosophy, forged in a battle against the intellectual abstractions of his time, offers an indispensable framework for navigating the concrete existential challenges of our digital age. His insistence on the irreducible value of the subjective, existing individual—den Enkelte—provides a powerful counter-narrative to the depersonalizing and deterministic tendencies of algorithmic culture. By re-examining his core concepts through the lens of contemporary technology and science, we find not an archaic curiosity, but a vital and urgent guide to preserving human agency and meaning.
The Kierkegaardian spheres of existence reveal the architecture of our digital world as an "aesthetic trap," designed to hold us in a state of perpetual distraction, while the logic of our AI systems mirrors the universalizing, yet ultimately insufficient, rationality of the ethical sphere. His analysis of Angst prefigures and explains the dual anxieties of the modern condition: the paralysis of infinite choice and the dread of predictive certainty. His central category of "the single one" stands as a defiant rebuke to the reduction of the human person to a "quantified self" or a data profile.
This Kierkegaardian perspective does not necessitate a Luddite rejection of technology. Instead, it calls for a profound and conscious choice about how we design and integrate these powerful tools into our lives. It demands that we ask whether our technologies are enhancing our capacity for authentic choice or systematically eroding it; whether they are serving the development of the self or commodifying it. It insists that we prioritize the preservation of "inefficient" but essential human activities—art, love, contemplation, and moral responsibility—in the face of a relentless drive toward optimization.
The ultimate insight from this analysis is that human existence possesses dimensions of meaning, value, and passion that cannot be captured in functional, utilitarian, or computational terms. Even if conscious, subjective experience proves to be "inefficient" when measured against the processing power of artificial intelligence, it remains the sole ground of authentic human existence. The choice to remain human—to preserve consciousness, to exercise agency, and to accept individual responsibility—may appear irrational from the standpoint of pure optimization, but it is the ultimate expression of human authenticity.
In an age of encroaching algorithmic certainty, the Kierkegaardian "leap of faith" is transformed. It is no longer solely a leap into a theological unknown, but a leap into our own humanity. It is the conscious, passionate decision to choose the human way of being—with all its ambiguity, inefficiency, and paradox—not because it is rationally superior or strategically advantageous, but as an act of ultimate commitment to who we are and who we choose to remain. This choice, made in the full, anxious awareness of its consequences, represents the definitive assertion of human freedom in the face of technological determinism.
