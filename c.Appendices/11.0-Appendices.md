These appendices provide deeper technical context for readers who want to understand the mechanisms behind the concepts discussed in the main text. For me, these technical appendices aren't just supplementary material; they are the bedrock upon which my thesis stands, an invitation to truly grapple with the 'how' behind the 'what'. My hope in presenting these technicalities is not to overwhelm, but to empower you with the kind of informed perspective I've had to carve out for myself, piece by piece. To choose to understand these details is to choose consciousness over convenience, to engage rather than to simply accept. They assume some technical background but aim to be accessible to motivated general readers. Mathematical formulas are explained conceptually where possible.
